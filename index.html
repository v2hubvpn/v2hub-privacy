  <h1>Privacy Policy for v2hub</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated: May 28, 2025</strong></p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We operate on a strict no-logs policy, meaning we do not collect, store, or monitor any data related to your online activities, 
    including browsing history, IP addresses, DNS queries, or connection timestamps. The only information we collect is limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we may collect your email address and username to manage your account and provide customer support.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect anonymized, aggregated data (e.g., server load statistics) to improve our services and ensure optimal performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect basic device information (e.g., device type, operating system version) to enhance compatibility and troubleshoot issues.</li>

  <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We employ industry-leading encryption protocols (e.g., AES-256) to secure your data during transmission and while using our VPN servers. 
    Our infrastructure is designed with multiple layers of protection to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, or interception by third parties. 
    However, no system is entirely immune to risks, and we encourage users to follow best practices for online security.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties, except in the following circumstances:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> If required by law, we may disclose information to comply with legal processes, such as court orders or government requests.</li>
    <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share anonymized data with trusted third-party providers (e.g., payment processors) to facilitate services like billing, but only to the extent necessary and under strict confidentiality agreements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
  <p>You have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access, update, or delete your account information at any time through the app settings.</li>
    <li>Opt out of non-essential communications (e.g., promotional emails).</li>
